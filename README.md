# Project-LandingPage

This is the first official project of TheOdinProject 
mostly created on my own. The goal is to creat a web page
completely from scratch to test my skills in flexbox and
in general to test myself to see how much I have retained.

I do not expect to have this done soon, but I know that I will
learn a trememndous amount thru these efforts. It's important
to follow along the Odin Project and to utilize Google for 
anything that I might not be familiar with.

Remember to utilize Flexbox and the myriad ways in which it can
be used to move around content.
